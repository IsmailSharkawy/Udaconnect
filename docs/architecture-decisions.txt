The reason Kafka was integrated as part of location coordinates collection step is because that 
step is the one that generates the most consistent continous traffic and so will result in performance 
decrease/user response delay as the service scales, the introduction of kafka ensures that the 
coordinates collection process happens asynchronously so user doesn't wait for location to be commited to
db and thus results in an overall smoother experience, gRPC was placed between person and connection to make 
use of speed up allowed by properly implemented gRPC service between two microservices.
